# MediaStockApp

A Single Page App for displaying live stock data. This project was generated with React/Redux.

## Description

A test project created showcasing my experience with React/Redux. The app uses WebSocket to fetch (dummy) data and create a live table showing the current price, the change and the time when it was updated. The WebSocket used is: ws://stocks.mnet.website.
